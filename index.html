        <p>This is <u>Gut</u> a <b>git</b> managment tool for people who don't like to spend their time diving into cmd tools.</p>
        <p>Git is version control history cli and server-side project made by Linus Torvalds. Git is used by many projects you use from day-to-day as a developer, such as:</p>
        <p> - Github</p>
        <p> - Azure Repos</p>
        <p> - Sublime Merger</p>
        <br>
        <p>Gut makes it easy to stage commits and push them with a simple CLI. Extremely basic and makes it easy to use git without learning annoying syntax that makes you want to rip your hair out.</p>
        <p>Gut makes it easy to learn due to its both online & offline man-pages!</p>
        <p>Gut makes it easy to create your own git repos, whether it be locally or on a server it makes creating and monitoring your commits easy.</p>
        <p>Gut is a play on git. The very nasty & horrible CLI that it is, now inherently git isn't a bad platform simply its exsisting CLI is.</p>
