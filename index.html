            <h1>Gut: Main</h1>
        <p>This is <u>Gut</u> a <b>git</b> managment tool for people who don't like to spend their time diving into cmd tools.</p>
        <p>Git is version control history cli and server-side project made by Linus Torvalds. Git is used by many projects you use from day-to-day as a developer, such as:</p>
        <p> - Github</p>
        <p> - Azure Repos</p>
        <p> - Sublime Merger</p>
        <br>
        <p>Gut makes it easy to stage commits and push them with a simple CLI. Extremely basic and makes it easy to use git without learning annoying syntax that makes you want to rip your hair out.</p>
        <p>Gut makes it easy to learn due to its both online & offline man-pages!</p>
        <p>Gut makes it easy to create your own git repos, whether it be locally or on a server it makes creating and monitoring your commits easy.</p>
        <p>Gut is a play on git. The very nasty & horrible CLI that it is, now inherently git isn't a bad platform simply its exsisting CLI is.</p>

            <h1>Gut: Download</h1>
            <p>Here are some download links, feel free to use curl/wget or just click on them.</p>
            <a href="/downloads/Gut/"><div class="download-box"><p>Beta 'Free public use' <img align="right" src="lambda.png" height="30px"></p></div></a>
            <a href="/downloads/Gut-Pre/"><div class="download-box"><p>Pre-Release 'Not stable' <img align="right" src="push.png" height="30px"></p></div></a>
            <a href="http://github.com/somewhere/something"><div class="download-box"><p>Website Source-Code <img align="right" src="growth.png" height="30px"></p></div></a>
            <p>Just as rule of thumb we dont suggest to use the 'Pre-Release' version as it may be unstable. Its simply where we put code for our beta testers. However the 'Beta' is suggested for use by the public due to it being more stable.</p>
